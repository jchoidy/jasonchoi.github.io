# Global Covid Deaths EDA + Dashboard

This project was born out of my curiosity to generally assess Covid restriction efficacy since 2020 around the globe, particularly by tracking infection rate trends over time in highly populated nations. 

## Process

After downloading the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), I transformed the tables in **Excel**, utilized **SQL** (PostgreSQL) to perform exploratory data analysis, and then extracted my key findings to visualize in **Tableau**.
