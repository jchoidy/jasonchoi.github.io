- I love watching movies of all genres and ratings, but I do love my comedies! I wanted to explore the rating distribution between different genres. Are there more rated R movies in Action? Are comedies generally PG-13? How do they differ globally? I wanted to create a dashboard from a database that's proven to keep records of the most popular movies out there.

## Dataset Summary
- Movie titles, attributes, budgets and revenues from IMDb (Internet Movie Database), 1920-2015

## Tools Used + Process
- **Tools**: Excel Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts
- **Process**: I utilized pivot tables to gather data on genre performance based on quantity of movies released and rating breakdown. I then a trends chart to analyze revenue spikes throughout the years and seeing which rating generated the most revenue that year. I then created Slicers to analyze these metrics by narrowing in on rating types or even expanding to different countries around the globe.
