- As a movie enthusiast, I appreciate all ratings, from R-rated horror to PG-rated cartoon comedies. I'm intrigued by the rating distribution across genres and its implications for audience analytics, particularly on a national scale. In this project, I delve into the revenue generated by common movie ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R) and explore whether certain ratings, like PG-13 and R, dominate due to their audience appeal.

## Dataset Summary
- Movie titles, attributes, budgets and revenues from IMDb (Internet Movie Database), 1920-2015

## Tools Used + Process
- **Tools**: Excel Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts
- **Process**: I used pivot tables to collect data between movie genres + ratings, considering the quantity of movies released for each dimension. Next, I created a trends chart to examine revenue spikes over the years and identify which rating generated the highest revenue annually. Finally, I implemented Slicers to analyze these metrics by focusing on specific rating types or expanding the analysis to different countries worldwide.

## EDA + Dashboard Takeaways
I examined US movie rating and genre revenue trends from 2007 to 2012:
- **PG Movies Leading Adventure Genre**: Adventure movies were predominantly led by PG-rated films. This could indicate a focus on family-friendly content within the adventure genre, appealing to a broad audience including children and families.
- **Similar Revenue Streams for R-rated and PG Movies**: Despite the higher volume of R-rated movies compared to PG movies, they generated similar revenue streams during this period. This indicates that while there may have been more R-rated movies released, PG-rated movies were still able to compete effectively in terms of box office success, perhaps due to successful family-friendly franchise films like Toy Story 3 (2010) or Up (2009).
- **Dominance of R-rated and PG-13 Movies**: Both R-rated and PG-13 movies were the most prevalent during this time, comprising over 400% more films than PG and G-rated movies combined. This suggests that filmmakers were targeting older audiences, aiming for content that could attract teenagers and adults.
